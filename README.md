# CreditCardFraudDetection

## Motivation For My Projects:

### Credit Card Fraud Detection:
### My partner and I's motivation for the credit card fraud detection project was solely based on the fact that identity theft and credit card default is so prevalent in the United States. We as a team felt the need to investigate the inner workings of the banking and credit system. Leveraging big data, we were able to pinpoint exactly which demographics possessed the greatest probability of commiting credit card fraud. However, our findings taught us more than we bargained for. Often times, we as human tend to approach different problems with our own predetermined biases. It is this bias that made our discovery all the more interesting and unpredictable. Through the coding and analyzing stages of this project, we learned to leave our biases and approach different problems with an open mind and unfiltered to best encapsulate all our findings.
